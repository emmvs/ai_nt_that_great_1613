Student.create(name: "Roberto Piazzolla", bio: "Hello! I am Roberto, I am 37 years old and I originally come from Italy. I have always been very passionate about computers since I got my first PC back in 1997, as the World Wide Web started spreading and got in everybody's houses, a truly exciting time. I love videogames and the newest advancements in computer graphics, dancing and ancient history. I started playing during the transition between 2D and 3D graphics. It was rather fascinating to me seeing how much PC hardware could be pushed in order to render amazing virtual worlds. One of my hobbies has always been building my own PCs and/or helping others building one, other than solving any issue that might have occurred. Also, being my partner a DJ, we really like going dancing together. It's a good way to relieve stress and have a good time. Another big passion of mine are ancient civilisations: over many years I have in fact studied Roman and Greek Archaeology. Art, architecture and history are some of my favorite subjects. I have been living in Berlin for 10 years, during this time I have been active in the gastronomy while also learning German and attending to the university. Then finally I had the chance to manage a Cafe in Mitte. After being laid off I have decided to leave this work field for good and start something new and completely different, something that I have always been willing to do, namely working in as a developer. The main reason for this is my curiosity, rather than being a passive actor using apps and websites I want to know how they work from the inside-out, understand the code that's behind it and how you can keep all the systems running efficiently, finally being able to create something on my own with the help of others. In the future I would really love to find a job as a backend developer, but I think this is for me just the beginning, as soon as I acquire more experience and knowledge I am willing to also try other fields in CS, I still have to find out which ones exactly.")
